### Postmortem Report: Web Application Outage

**Issue Summary**

- **Duration**: The outage lasted for 3 hours and 15 minutes, starting on August 12, 2024, at 09:30 AM UTC and ending at 12:45 PM UTC.
- **Impact**: During the outage, 70% of users experienced slow load times, and 30% were completely unable to access the web application. The issue primarily affected users in North America and Europe. The affected services included the main web application and the API used by third-party integrations.
- **Root Cause**: The root cause was an unoptimized database query combined with an unexpected spike in traffic due to a viral marketing campaign. This led to database server overload and cascading failures in the application.

### Timeline

- **09:30 AM UTC**: Issue detected through automated monitoring alerts indicating increased response times and error rates.
- **09:35 AM UTC**: Engineers confirmed the issue by manually checking logs and noticing slow database queries.
- **09:40 AM UTC**: Initial investigation focused on potential network issues or DDoS attacks, but no anomalies were found.
- **10:00 AM UTC**: The investigation shifted to the application layer, with a focus on the load balancer and web servers. No issues were found.
- **10:30 AM UTC**: Database performance was analyzed, revealing that certain queries were taking significantly longer to execute than usual.
- **10:45 AM UTC**: The team identified a specific database query that was running a full table scan, causing a bottleneck.
- **11:00 AM UTC**: Incident escalated to the Database Engineering team for further investigation.
- **11:30 AM UTC**: Database query was optimized and indexes were added to the affected tables.
- **12:00 PM UTC**: Traffic was temporarily rerouted to a secondary data center to alleviate load on the primary database.
- **12:30 PM UTC**: Monitoring showed a gradual return to normal operation as the database handled traffic more efficiently.
- **12:45 PM UTC**: Full service was restored, and all users were able to access the application without issues.

### Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause**:  
The issue was caused by an unoptimized SQL query that performed a full table scan on a large database table. The situation was exacerbated by a sudden spike in traffic, triggered by a viral marketing campaign, which the system was not prepared to handle. The database server became overloaded, leading to slow query execution times and eventually causing timeouts for a significant portion of users.

**Resolution**:  
To resolve the issue, the problematic query was identified and optimized by adding appropriate indexes to the table. This reduced the query execution time significantly. Additionally, traffic was temporarily rerouted to a secondary data center to reduce the load on the primary database server. Once the database was stabilized, normal traffic routing was restored, and the application returned to full functionality.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements**:
- **Database Optimization**: Regular audits of database queries and indexing strategies should be implemented to prevent similar issues in the future.
- **Traffic Management**: Implement traffic throttling or rate limiting during unexpected spikes to protect critical infrastructure components like the database.
- **Monitoring Enhancements**: Improve monitoring to include alerts for slow-running queries and database performance issues specifically.

**Task List**:
1. **Optimize SQL Queries**: Review and optimize all queries that interact with large tables, ensuring they use appropriate indexes.
2. **Add Indexes**: Implement additional indexes on frequently accessed database columns to improve query performance.
3. **Traffic Throttling**: Develop and deploy a traffic throttling mechanism to prevent overload during unexpected spikes.
4. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Update monitoring systems to trigger alerts when query execution times exceed predefined thresholds.
5. **Load Testing**: Conduct regular load testing under various traffic conditions to ensure system resilience during high traffic events.
